## Usage

You can either download a zip file containing the directory, or you can clone it by using

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/psotob91/kfre-ckd-reba-peru
```

In either case, you can then use the `kfre-ckd-reba-peru.Rproj` file to open and Rstudio session in the directory you have just downloaded. You may then knit both quarto files, or run them line-by-line.
